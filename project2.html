        <h2>Car Shopping List Project</h2>
        <section class="project-description">
            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>I developed a car shopping list where users can filter, sort, and save their favorite cars. It integrates shopping cart features inspired by well-known platforms such as Rotten Tomatoes, Goodreads, and Yelp.
                My goal was to create a user-friendly interface that simplifies the car shopping experience, making it easier for users to find their dream car.</p>
            </p>
        </section>
        <section class="features">
            <h3>Process and Inspiration</h3>
            <p>The project drew inspiration from the following features on popular platforms, adapting them to my context of car shopping:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Rotten Tomatoes Reset Filters:</strong> This feature allows users to reset their selection to default settings after exploring various filters, such as sorting by 1-star-rated Action Movies.</li>

                <li><strong>Goodreads Batch Edit Filters:</strong> Helps in managing large sets of items, like deleting multiple books at once which has been adapted to manage car selections effectively.</li>
                <img src="GoodReads.png" alt="GoodReads Example" class="center">
                <li><strong>Yelpâ€™s Filter by Category:</strong> Allows users to categorize searches like filtering restaurants, adapted to categorize cars by type, price, and more.</li>
                <img src="Yelp.png" alt="Yelp Example" class="center">
            </ul>
            <h3>Key Features and Comparison</h3>
            <p>The table below provides a comparison of features adapted from Rotten Tomatoes, Goodreads, and Yelp:</p>
            <table class="feature-table">

            <h3>My Role in the Project</h3>
            <p>This was a solo project where I researched existing aggregator interfaces, chose relevant features that worked well for my car website, iterated different designs, and then coded a fully functioning React app.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="visuals">
            <h3>The Final App</h3>
            <p>I implemented a multi-filter interface with options to filter by car type, color, and price, alongside a reset filter and a visually informative card view. I decided on these three filter types after interviewing
                10 car buyers and prioritized what matters most when shopping for cars. The next steps would be to add a sort by price feature and a smart recommendation system.
