        <h2>Valet Notes - The Ultimate Note-Taking Solution</h2>
        <section class="overview">
            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>My friend Chinmay and I had a habit of recording information but not being able to find it when we needed to. So we built Valet Notes. Its a note taking app that automatically organizes your information and helps you find exactly what you're looking for when you need to. </p>

            <h3>My Role</h3>
            <p>I conducted over 50 user interviews with students, researchers, and professionals, studying their note taking habits and examining the existing softwares they used. I then helped design the UI for Valet Notes and also collaborated on the backend architecture.</p>

            <h3>Technology Stack</h3>
            <p>We used knowledge graphs and vector databases to organize information and used semantic search and GPT - 4 to help retrieve information when the user searched for it.

            <h3>Development Iterations</h3>
            <p>Based on user feedback, we decided to build this into a chrome extension. We realized users spent a lot of time on browsers and wanted to save useful information they could easily retrieve while browsing the web. We also used shortcuts to further simplify the note-taking process based on feedback. Users could now record information with a few key strokes. </p>

            <h3>Future Directions</h3>
            <p>While Valet Notes has been well-received, monetizing a note-taking application presents unique challenges. We are currently exploring potential use cases in various industries, such as healthcare and construction, where professionals manage substantial amounts of information. These sectors have shown a willingness to invest in robust tools that can streamline data management and enhance operational efficiency, offering promising opportunities for the expansion and commercial success of Valet Notes.</p>
