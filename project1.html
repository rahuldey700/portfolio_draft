            <h2>Zest Shopping Cart - Enhancing Corporate Gifting</h2>
            <p><a href="https://www.zest.co/">Zest</a> is a corporate gifting platform that connects brands to corporate gifters. Zest approached our team with a feature request to add a shopping cart to their existing UI consistent with their style and practices.</p>
            <p>This project involved an iterative design process, where we worked closely with the Zest team to develop a shopping cart feature tailored for corporate gifting, enhancing the online shopping experience for Zest's users.</p>

            <h3>Team and Role</h3>
            <p>I worked alongside Dalton Simonson, Patricia Montalvo Hernandez, and Vishak Vinod. My role was primarily focused on UX design and front-end development, ensuring the shopping cart's seamless integration with existing UI elements.</p>

        <section class="problem-statement">
            <h3>Problem</h3>
            <p>The challenge was to create a shopping cart that could handle multiple items and quantities per recipient without confusing the user, especially in a large catalog scenario. The existing UI shows no shopping cart and inability to add multiple items.</p>

            <h3>Solution Overview</h3>
            <p>We introduced a side-cart feature, which allows users to manage their selections efficiently while continuing to browse, significantly enhancing user experience. We also added the ability
                for users to select multiple items of each type.

            <h3>Design Process</h3>
            <p>The process began with sketching early user flows to address the identified pain points. This was followed by developing wireframes and collaborating closely with subject matter experts to refine our designs.</p>

            <h3>Early Prototypes</h3>
            <p>Early prototypes were developed to explore different ways of handling multiple items and quantities. We tested these with users to understand their preferences and pain points.</p>

            <h3>Wireframes v1</h3>
            <p>We then created our first wireframe iteration and sent it to the client for feedback</p>

            <h3>Client Feedback v1</h3>
            <p>Our first client feedback had 2 primary critiques:</p>
            <li>The interface with "+ QYT -" showing up after each product selection is easy to use. However, it is unclear at this point of the experience if QTY is the number of products each recipient will receive or the number of recipients in the entire order. Said differently, if the user is sending gifts to 10 recipients and each recipient is to receive 2 Mini Artist box, should the user set the quantity to 10 or 2? Making this clear will be key to launching this feature.</li>
            <li>Liked the shopping cart feature and sidecart very much. Requested a mobile version for this functionality.</li>
        </section>
        <section class="final-outcomes">
            <h3>Wireframes v2</h3>
            <p>We revised our wireframe based on this critique. <li>Added the cart to the top corner when the side-cart is not popped out so the user can know about the cart feature and is not surprised by it later when it pops out when an item is added.</li> 
                <img src="hi-fi2.png" alt="Early Prototype of Shopping Cart">

            <li>We changed our tags to show not just quantity but to display that quantity is intended per user. This distinction is reinforced by the notice at the top of the sidecart. </li> 
            <img src="hi-fi1.png" alt ="Early Prototype of Shopping Cart">
            <img src="hi-fi3.png" alt="Early Prototype of Shopping Cart">

            <li> Mobile wireframes were also added with a slightly modified UI. Due to the lack of UI real-estate, the cart was designed to cover the whole screen upon selection. The items are also listed in a row instead of a matrix. The biggest change was the addition of a newer section at the bottom for the user to be able to review their items before checking out. This ties back to the original goal of keeping the user informed of their selections before they make a purchase.</li>  </p>

            <h2>Final Feedback</h2>
            <p>During our meeting with the company, we presented an alternative method for the user shopping experience, which was well received. We also confirmed that our current approach is effective, especially since we considered the company's preference for minimal changes. We received the following critical feedback:</p>
            
            <h3>Desktop Critique</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>It is unclear how the quantity per recipient changes when items are added or removed using the icon.</li>
                <li>The color of the Remove button is not visible enough.</li>
                <li>Consider making the cart accessible across all sections of the site.</li>
                <li>The Brightland logo appears twice in the cart.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Mobile Critique</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>The title in the Review Items Section is confusing. It's unclear whether it refers to each recipient or to all items collectively.</li>
            </ul>
        
            <h3>Final Feedback Implementation</h3>
            <p>After reviewing the feedback from the meeting, we decided to redesign the desktop version of the shopping cart, focusing mostly on the opened cart and the item selection. The main modifications implemented were the following:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>In order to avoid showing the logo in different parts of the screen, we decided to fix the top section of the interface. In this manner, regardless of the scroll position, the logo of the store is always visible on the top left corner. Following this decision, we deleted the logo from the shopping cart.</li>
                <li>Within the item selection, again, we fixed the heading of the selection. This heading includes the button to access the cart, which we believe should be accessible at all times while browsing items.</li>
                <li>Within the item selection, we added different states to the cart button, to show its status (inactive/empty/with items).</li>
                <li>When the cart is open, we leveled its container to the filter and sorting buttons, to simplify the layout and make the navigation more user friendly.</li>
                <li>Additionally, we fixed and simplified the content of the open cart. Our main goal was to make it more clear that the item selection is represented per recipient. With this goal, we also modified the title from: "Your shopping cart", to: "Your item selection".</li>
                <li>Furthermore, we added an option to delete items directly from the cart rather than just modify its quantity, and we added an additional feature: a calculator (to estimate the cart total, simulating the number of recipients).</li>
                <li>Moreover, we removed the checkout button from the opened cart to reduce confusion and we changed the hide option to a simple X in the upper left corner of the cart.</li>
                <li>Within the product cards, we rearranged the add, decrease, and remove buttons to make it easier to understand and navigate. Additionally, we returned to our original version of the delete button as it proved to be more intuitive. In order to decide the final aesthetic of the product cards, different versions were drafted and rated by 12 users, which allowed us to arrive at our final iteration.</li>
            </ul>
