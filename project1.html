    <h1>Zest Shopping Cart</h1>
    <h2>1. Zest Shopping Cart</h2>
    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>Zest makes corporate gifting easy. It is a platform
    that connected brands with companies looking to buy
    gifts for their employees and clients.</p>
    <p>Zest approached our team with a feature request to
    add a shopping cart to their existing UI consistent
    with their style and practices.</p>
    <details class="project">
        <div>
            <h2>Bulls Eye customer description</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Gift buyers who are purchasing more than one
                product</li>
                <li>Gift buyer sending multiple products to each
                recipient</li>
                <li>Gift buyer sending multiple qty of the same
                thing to each recipient</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>User Pain Points</h2>
            <p>When a brand has a large catalog, gift buyerâ€™s
            selections are not easily accessible, and they forget
            what they selected or are frustrated trying to find
            it. There is no shopping cart</p>
            <p>The current design does have quantity selection,
            and customer cannot send more than 1 of each product
            to a recipient</p>
            <h2>Early Sketches</h2>
            <p>To address these pain points, we sketched 3 user flows to add a shopping cart and allow for multiple item selection:
            </p>
            <h2> Wireframes</h2>
            <p> We felt our designs had strong merit and fit within the style Zest had cultivated and wanted to create some beginner wireframes to visualize our ideas in a more realistic implementation.</p>
            <p> We added a quantity indicator to the card item itself and added a "side-cart". The purpose of our decision to add this side cart was to tackle the pain point of gifter's not knowing what was already in their cart while shopping, especially on larger orders. This feature would allow the gifter to simultaneously browse the shop and view the contents of their cart.</p>
            <h2>Critique</h2>
            <p>Having the featured gifts dropdown above the cart is confusing. Does this mean you are sorting the cart or the items being browsed?
                The scheme for displaying item quantity is intuitive and does not present any "suprises"
                An addition of a cart button or symbol prior to the cart popping out from an item being added would inform the user there is a cart feature they will be able to utilized later.
                </p>
            <h2>Client CheckIn</h2>
            <p> We reached out to the client with our loom video for feedback and received the following feedback:
                The interface with "+ QYT -" showing up after each product selection is easy to use. However, it is unclear at this point of the experience if QTY is the number of products each recipient will receive or the number of recipients in the entire order. Said differently, if the user is sending gifts to 10 recipients and each recipient is to receive 2 Mini Artist box, should the user set the quantity to 10 or 2? Making this clear will be key to launching this feature.
                We don't see the side cart bar as a meaningful competitive differentiator, but also it does not need to be. We like the concept of the sidebar very much, it solves the problem you captured at the beginning of the loom and gives the user a clear understanding of what they have selected. We're curious where you would put the side cart in mobile view. We'll love to see a mockup for that.
                </p>

        <h2>Improved Wireframes</h2>
        <p>
            With the subject matter expert advice and critique along with the feeback the client provided the team, we revised our wireframe. We added the cart to the top corner when the side-cart is not popped out so the user can know about the cart feature and is not suprised by it later when it pops out when an item is added. Addittionally we changed our tags to show not just quantity but to display that quantity is intended per user. This distinction is reinforced by the notice at the top of the sidecart.
            Mobile wireframes were also added with a slightly modified UI. Due to the lack of UI real-estate, the cart was designed to cover the whole screen upon selection. The items are also listed in a row instead of a matrix. The biggest change was the addition of a newer section at the bottom for the user to be able to review their items before checking out. This ties back to the original goal of keeping the user informed of their selections before they make a purchase.
